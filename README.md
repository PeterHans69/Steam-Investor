# For The programmers
I know the code is messy, its my first project I have ever ended.
Feel free to improve it!

### Installing the application with visual studio:
* Go to `MyPathes.cs` and change these variables to:
  * `public static string path = Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location);`
  * `public static string MySteamItems = path + "\\MySteamItems.json;`
* After that go to "App.manifest" and change `<requestedExecutionLevel level="asInvoker" uiAccess="false" />` to `<requestedExecutionLevel level="requireAdministrator" uiAccess="false" />` so the application can save the users data.
